# Website Load Time Checker

This Python script measures the time taken to load a website by requesting the URL and calculating the time difference. It uses the `urlopen` function from the `urllib.request` module to open the URL and the `time` module to measure the time.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone the repository or download the script.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the script using `python load_time_checker.py`.
5. Enter the URL for which you want to measure the load time when prompted.
6. The script will display the time taken to load the website in seconds.

## Example

```bash
py main.py
Enter the URL whose loading time you want to check: www.example.com
The time taken to load www.example.com is 0.76 seconds.
```
